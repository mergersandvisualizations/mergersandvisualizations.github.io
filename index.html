                            valued significantly higher than all other sectors, with early industry developments that paved the way
                            for future technological growth. Subsequently, rapid development of Consumer Electronics and the Internet
                            of Things, like mobile devices, from 2006 to 2010. Mobile developments created a looming impact on enterprise
                            and user-centered design. <br><br>

                            At the same time, starting in 2008, digital experience, analytics, and cloud technologies started growing.
                            Their disruptive potential evolved and expanded across industries, as they have become foundational concepts
                            not only of enterprise technology, but of corporate strategy of all firms. <br><br>

                            Starting in 2016, with the growth of SaaS, Big Data, and Cybersecurity that are driven by cognitive technologies
                            such as machine learning, robotic process automation, natural language processing, and neural nets, the race of
                            tech companies to integrate such powerful data to innovate and gain market power is evident.

                <br>
                <b>What is an acquisition?</b> An acquisition is defined as a financial interaction in which one company purchases most or all of another company's shares to gain control of that company. Purchasing more than 50% of that firm's stock and assets allows the acquirer to make decisions about the company’s assets without needing the approval of that company’s shareholders. They can occur with the target company’s approval, or can occur in spite of its disapproval of the interaction. Often, acquisitions are completed because they allow the larger company to skip the growth stage and buy existing sales and profits, possess rights to patents and technological advances, gain access to new markets, implement vertical integration by buying a supplier or end user of an existing product, take advantage of economies of scale, buy out a competitor, and/or to inherit strong leadership.
                <br><br>
                To provide insight into how the tech giants managed to achieve the huge gains in market caps shown in the previous visualization, we explored the acquisitions that the 5 companies made between 1979 and 2019 as well as the overall trends in the volume of tech industry acquisitions.

                        As the dynamic visualization plays and dots representing companies move across the screen as they are acquired, we can draw conclusions about the acquisition practices of each of the big 5 companies. We can watch as Microsoft and Apple are the two main pre-2000 acquirers, then as they are joined by Apple in 1998, Google in 2001, and finally Facebook in 2007. Despite Google’s later start, it ended up nearly matching Microsoft in acquisition volume with a comparable distribution of SaaS, hardware, and media acquisitions. Similar comparisons can be drawn between other pairs and groups of the tech giants through this visualization.
                        <br><br>
                        It is especially interesting to see which sectors each tech giant focuses its acquisitions on and how they emphasize different sectors throughout the years. For instance, while Apple and Microsoft focused their acquisitions on SaaS (software as a service) in their early developmental years and only later began to acquire companies from niche sectors, Amazon started out by acquiring many media and commerce companies and only recently (2014 and beyond) began acquiring SaaS companies as they moved away from being purely an e-commerce site and into new domains.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, this visualization emphasizes how many acquisitions Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft have made on their journey to the top of the tech industry. These acquisitions have been key to their success in penetrating new markets, developing new technologies, crushing their competition, and developing into the monopolies that they are today.

                            The volume of acquisitions in the tech industry aligns with the historical growth of the tech industry, and therefore can be viewed as an indicator of the health and activity of the sector.
                            <br><br>
                            At first, volume grew steadily from a mere 70 acquisitions in 1896 to a maximum of nearly 7500 deals at the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2001. Coincidentally, dot-com businesses grew rapidly in the late 1990s through 2001 and internet-based businesses thrived, mostly funded by venture capitalists and banks looking to get in on the internet trend. It was not until 2002 that the tech bubble truly burst, resulting in a significant decrease in net acquisitions in the industry. Some proposed reasons for the bursting of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s include the simultaneous general economic recession, expositions of corporate corruption at several large tech companies, and an overvaluation of stocks combined with faulty business plans of many technology startups.
                        </div>
                        Less than half of the affected dot-com companies survived until 2004, and many of those that did survive became more cautious about expanding, which aligns with the 2004-2008 period of slow increase in acquisition volume. Other companies, however, bounced back from the crash, including today’s tech giants, Amazon and Google.
                        <br><br>
                        The Great Recession of 2008, a period of general economic decline, caused a similar drop in the volume of tech acquisitions lasting from 2009 until 2013. The past 5 years have seen a steady medium rate of acquisitions, with no sign of slowing down. Although the 2019 bar looks smaller than the others, the data does not include fourth-quarter deals and is projected to be similar to last year’s volume.

                <br>
                These 5 tech giants have a profound impact on society, from our daily lives to the structure of the national and global economies. Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft are household names and used daily by millions of Americans, yet are rampant with potential issues that pose threats to the country on an individual and societal level. The companies have received extensive criticism for data breaches, harvesting user data, and developing into imposing monopolies able to stifle competition before it even becomes a threat. These issues do not go unnoticed: Facebook was recently sued for misusing internal information and breaching privacy agreements, Google is facing billions of dollars in potential fines over its antitrust practices, and Senator Elizabeth Warren recently proposed a plan to force big tech breakups and impose severe restrictions on the remnants while seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. In this section, we investigate the general public opinion of the 5 tech giants and their monopolization of the industry.
                <br><br>

                        The following three visualizations detail the results of polls to the general public on their opinion of the 5 companies, whether or not they are concerned about the monopolization of the tech industry, and their view on a potential policy to reverse recent mergers to break up the tech giants.

                        <br>

                        The first visualization reveals an overall positive view of all 5 tech giants, ranging from a cumulative 81% “Strongly positive” or “Somewhat positive” for Amazon to 55% for Facebook. While this aligns with the widespread use (and perhaps dependence) on these companies, this is surprising considering the recent negative publicity of privacy scares and antitrust issues.
                        <br><br>
                        However, the second and third visualizations seem to conflict with the first visualization: while the first chart shows significant positive view of the companies, the pie chart reveals a majority negative feeling toward the tech sector being dominated by only a few tech companies (45% to 37%) and the bar chart shows that a significant majority supports undoing recent mergers, regardless of political leaning. This seems to reveal a complex public view of the companies: while the big tech companies provide innumerable services to the general public and sometimes use their resources to do good, there is still general distress about their monopolization of the industry.
                        <br><br>
                        The last visualization demonstrates that the public believes that the most powerful companies should use their power to address social issues. Education is most valued, followed by Fighting Poverty and Environmentalism.
                        <br><br>
                        This is an opportunity for the most wealthy companies to look into potential acquisition targets focused in those specific areas in order to align their values with those of the public.
